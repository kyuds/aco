# aco
Ant Colony Optimization
```
make && ./aco
```
The Ant Colony Optimization formulation for the traveling salesman problem is implemented in both multithreaded and singlethreaded contexts. To make the program multithreaded or vice versa, simply change the comment of the `#define` statement indicating using multiple threads in `aco.hh`. Otherwise, change the compiler flags!
